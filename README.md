# Recipe book

The project is a web app for managing food recipes. Users can add, modify and
remove recipes. A user has an account, and can only manage their own recipes.

The app also features a shopping list for ingredients. Users can add ingredients
to the shopping list, either manually or directly from the recipe view.

Originally this was a project for the course "Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂:
tietokantasovellus" at the University of Helsinki. That version is stored in the
`course-project` branch.
